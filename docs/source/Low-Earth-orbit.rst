Low-Earth orbit
===============

JPSS
----

The `Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) <https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/our-satellites/currently-flying/joint-polar-satellite-system>`_ is NOAA's low-earth orbitting satellite program. JPSS satellites circle the Earth from pole to pole and cross the equator about 14 times a day in the afternoon orbit to provide full global coverage twice a day. JPSS data is very important for numerical weather forecasting in the U.S. and deliver critical observations during severe weather events like hurricanes and blizzards. JPSS consists of 5 satellites:

- Suomi NPP
- NOAA 20
- NOAA 21
- JPSS 3 (will be NOAA 22)
- JPSS 4 (will be NOAA 23)

Each satellite has a VIS/IR imager (VIIRS), an IR sounder (CrIS), a microwave sounder (ATMS), and an ozone mapper (OMPS).

Oribt tracks
------------

The University of Wisconsin -- Madison Space Science and Engineering Center provides a resource to see `historical and future tracks <https://www.ssec.wisc.edu/datacenter/polar_orbit_tracks/>`_ (next few days) for many polar-orbitting satellites.
