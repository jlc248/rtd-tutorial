Weather Satellite Resources
===================================

This wiki provides some organization to weather satellite resources that are available. 

Check out the :doc:`Geostationary` section for further information on geostationary satellite instruments, which continuously view the earth from the same position, 35,786 km (22,236 miles) above the earth's surface.

:doc:`Low-Earth-orbit` satellites are much closer to the earth (200-1600 km above the surface), and often have instruments with better spatial resolution than their geostationary counterparts. However, their return periods can be considerable -- 12 hours or more. The phenomena you are interested in will help determine which satellite instrument data to use for your research.

:doc:`Utilities` provides some scripts to compute the solar-zenith angle, satellite-viewing angle (aka satellite-zenith angle), and parallax correction for :doc:`Geostationary` satellites, assuming a constant cloud height.
